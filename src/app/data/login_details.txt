# Event Ticketing System - Login Credentials

Since the application uses a mock authentication system, you can use the following credentials to test the different user roles. Use any password (e.g., `password123`).

### 1. Admin Role
- **Email:** `admin@eventhub.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Note:** Admins have full access to event moderation, user management, and platform settings.

### 2. Organizer Role
- **Email:** `organizer@events.com`
- **Password:** `organizer123`
- **Note:** Organizers can create events, manage their own events, and view sales analytics.

### 3. Attendee Role
- **Email:** `attendee@user.com`
- **Password:** `attendee123`
- **Note:** Attendees can browse events, book tickets (in ₹), and view their ticket history.

**Tip:** For new accounts, use the "Create Account" page. Remember that "Admin" accounts cannot be created via the registration page anymore (as per recent updates); use the pre-defined admin email above for testing admin features.
